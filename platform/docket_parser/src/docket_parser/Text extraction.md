Content Streams
---
Text is stored in the PDF content streams. 
Specifically, all displayed text originates from a `Tj` or `TJ` operation in the content stream.
Each page has exactly one content stream, which describes how to draw everything on the page. 
Content streams can reference Resources which are stored elsewhere in the PDF, such as fonts and images.


It's rarely advisable to scrape text information out of a content stream, but our case is one of those rare situations.
Because: 
- The PDFs are generated by the state website upon request, rather than stored on their servers.
- The software that generates the PDFs (Crystal Reports by SAP) writes the content stream the same way each time, 
only changing with new versions of that software.
- The order of text in the content stream is amenable to parsing with a relatively simple Parsing Expressive Grammar (PEG)

PDF content streams are stateful, and important elements of the current state for us are:
- Font name
- Font size
- Text matrix (`tm` in pypdf). "Where the text cursor is" in text space units
- Current transformation matrix (a.k.a. CTM, or `cm` in pypdf). 
Text matrix multiplied by CTM yields user space matrix, which describes where things end up on the page

Pypdf keeps track of text matrix and current transformation matrix for us, and passes it to our operand visitor.
We need to keep track of font name and font size, which are components of the Text State. 
The text state is in turn a component of the Graphics State.
There is a graphics state stack, which is pushed to and popped from with the operators `q` and `Q` respectively.
We need to keep track of that stack.



Character IDs (a.k.a. cid's)
---
Each character in a font has a character id (cid). For the fonts we're looking at, the cids are one byte each.
The individual text characters actually rendered on the display/printer are called **glyphs**.
Fonts must describe how cids map to glyphs, and how to draw the glyphs. 
Fonts can also optionally include a /ToUnicode character map, which describes how character ids map to unicode characters.
This /ToUnicode map is essential for extracting text from PDFs. 
pypdf provides a function to parse the /ToUnicode character map and return a python dictionary mapping cids to unicode characters. 
The function `get_unicode_map` in font.py converts those keys to integers, and returns a dictionary mapping integer cids to unicode characters.
For some fonts, the character ids are equal to the ascii characters they represent, making the content streams somewhat readable.
This is not true in general, and is not the case for the fonts found in recently generated pacourts PDFS.
PDFs generated on pacourts website use TrueType fonts, with a /ToUnicode character map.


Note: The actual content stream of the PDF is compressed. 
qpdf, the software which pypdf relies on, handles compression/decompression.
We don't need to worry about it.


Here is the first few lines of an uncompressed PDF content stream from a docket. Each character is one ascii-encoded byte.

Currently, the only operators that we look at are:
- `TF` Sets current font and font size.
- `Td` Applies a transformation to text matrix. Effectively, moves where the next shown text will start.
- `q`, `Q` Push and pop, respectively, from the graphics state stack (which includes text state).
- `ET` Ends text block.
- `Tj` Shows a string of characters.
- `TJ` Shows a string of characters, allowing for horizontal position adjustments between characters.

pypdf does some processing of the content stream before passing its contents to our visitor function. 
For example, where the content stream has the bytes `[ (A) 35 ( COUNT) (Y) 17 (  ) ] TJ`, 
pypdf will convert the operand to a python list of `bytes` and `int`s:
`[b'A', 35, b' COUNT', b'Y', 17, b'  ']`.
pypdf will also convert the hexadecimal strings like `<53454355524520444f434b4554>` into python bytes objects, where each byte is one character id:
`b'SECURE DOCKET'`.

The extract_text method of DocketReader and DocketPageObject can take an optional bool `debug_log_operations`.
If this argument is True, all operations will be logged at log level `DEBUG`, in the format that pypdf sends them to our visitor,
except the arguments for `Tj` and `TJ` will be decoded.
`DocketReader._debug_get_all_operations` returns a list of all operations, without decoding text.

X and Y tolerance
---
Text is considered to be on the same line if y position adjustment is less than y_tolerance.
This is necessary because many logical lines on these PDFs have slight variations in y coordinates.

Similarly, we use x_tolerance whenever we check if two horizontal positions are the same. 

Both tolerances are measured in text space units.

Segments
---
We process the text into 'segments' which are sequences of text with the same properties usually on the same horizontal line.
We concatenate decoded characters from `Tj` and `TJ` operations to build the segments.
We also keep track of the horizontal displacement of the segments, so that we can tell if a `Td` operation moves the cursor 
directly at the end of the last character shown, or far enough to insert a tab.
We end one segment and start the next when one of the following occurs in the content stream:
- `Tf` or `Q` operators, which change the font and or font size.
- `ET` operator, which indicates the end of a text block.
- `Td` operator that moves the cursor vertically more than the y_tolerance, UNLESS it looks like a new line of a text box

We say that we're in a (left justified) textbox if the cursor is moved directly under the start of the current segment,
within x_tolerance of the starting x position.

Special inserted characters
---
We use a handful of special characters to indicate different kinds of text spacing/positioning.
The actual character inserted in output text is determined by the DocketReader.
For parsing, it is very important that the inserted characters do not appear in the text of the PDF.
- `terminator` - inserted at the end of each segment
- `tab` - inserted when the cursor moves to the right on the same line, at least x_tolerance*font size past the end of the last shown character
- `comes_before` - inserted when the cursor moves to the left on the same line
- `box_wrap` - inserted when a left justified textbox continues to the next line
- `properties_open` and `properties_close` - used to delimit the information we add at the end of each segment in the output

User space coordinates and font type are added at the end of each segment
