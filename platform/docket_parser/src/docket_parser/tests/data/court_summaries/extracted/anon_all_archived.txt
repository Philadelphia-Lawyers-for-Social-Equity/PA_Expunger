Recent entries made in the court filing offices may not be immediately reflected on the court summary report. Neither the courts of the Unified Judicial ^System of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania nor the Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts assume any liability for inaccurate or delayed ^data, errors or omissions on these reports. Court Summary Report information should not be used in place of a criminal history background check ^which can only be provided by the Pennsylvania State Police. Moreover an employer who does not comply with the provisions of the Criminal History ^Record Information Act may be subject to civil liability as set forth in 18 Pa.C.S. Section 9183.^Please note that if the offense disposition information is blank, this only means that there is not a “final disposition” recorded in the Common Pleas ^Criminal Court Case Management System for this offense.  In such an instance, you must view the public web docket sheet of the case wherein the ^offense is charged in order to determine what the most up-to-date disposition information is for the offense.[036.00,119.55,normal]
